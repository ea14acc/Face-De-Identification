# Face-De-Identification

This project aims to develop a GUI-based demonstration system for face de-identification, with the industry visitors as the main target audience. The developed demonstration system will take a still image or a video sequence of a personâ€™s face as the input and then replace the identity in the given input to protect privacy whilst preserving the facial expressions and movements. For example, the demonstration system may display two synchronised video sequences simultaneously, with one video showing a welcome footage from a member of the face de-identification research team whilst the other video showing the same welcome message but from a well-known figure such as David Cameron, Barack Obama, or an artificial character generated by a de-identification process. The main challenge of this project is the real time operation of the demo system which will have to rely on the use of GPUs or graphic cards.
